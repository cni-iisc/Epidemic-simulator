## Design 

<img src="_static/images/workflow.png" alt="workflow">

The workflow of the simualtor has four stages:

- Prepare data to instantiate a synthetic city
-  Instantiation of a synthetic city with the number of agents being equal to the population of the instantiated city
-  Designing custom interventions to study
-  Running simulations, for large-scale simulations HPCs are required


This page will describe the workflow design of the simulator, the implementation side of things
