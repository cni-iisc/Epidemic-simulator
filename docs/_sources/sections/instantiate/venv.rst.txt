Creating a Virtual Environment in Python
==========================================
In order to run the city building script, we would need to get a few python packages. It would be easiest to not mess with the internal python distribution and get these packages on a separate virtual environment.

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    $ ~/tutorial/markov_simuls > python3 -m venv edaDev
    $ ~/tutorial/markov_simuls > source edaDev/bin/activate
    (edaDev) $ ~/tutorial/markov_simuls >


Installing the necessary packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This will create a separate folder called `edaDev` which is a local sandbox for everything we are doing. All packages that we will now install within the `edaDev` virtual environment will be installed inside this folder and will not affect the whole system.

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    (edaDev) $ ~/tutorial/markov_simuls > pip install -r staticInst/requirements.txt


With these packages installed, we are now ready to actually build the city.
